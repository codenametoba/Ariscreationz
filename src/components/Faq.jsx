      question: "How far in advance should I book your services?",
      answer:
        "How far in advance should I book your services? Honestly, the earlier, the better! Hereâ€™s the breakdown: For Coordination, at least a month to work our magic. For Decor, we need 3 months to make your vision come to life. For Full Planning, 6 months is ideal. That said, weâ€™ve planned a whole wedding in less than 10 days before and still delivered! So while we love having time to finesse every details, if youâ€™re on a tight timeline, just holler. We thrive under (reasonable) pressure!",
